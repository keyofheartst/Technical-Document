Dear Hiring Team at BJAK,
I recently learned that your company is hiring for the Data Engineer position, and I’m excited to submit my application for consideration. 

I’m writing to express my interest in the Data Engineer position. With over 6 years of experience delivering end-to-end data solutions, including designing scalable data platforms and orchestrating ETL pipelines, I believe my background aligns well with many aspects of the role.

In my current position as a Senior Data Engineer at United Insurance Company of Vietnam, I’ve led cloud-based data pipeline projects using AWS services such as Glue, S3, and Athena. I’m proficient in Python and SQL, and have hands-on experience with Airflow for workflow orchestration. My work has consistently involved designing data models, building ELT pipelines, and deploying reporting systems that support high-performance data access.

Throughout my career, I’ve participated in multiple projects both as a team member and as a team lead, contributing to the design and implementation of data systems and solutions on both on-premise and cloud platforms. These experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate across teams, manage project timelines, and deliver scalable, reliable data infrastructure tailored to business needs.

I’m confident that my experience in building robust data infrastructures and my proactive approach to problem-solving would allow me to contribute effectively to your team. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and background could support your goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further.

Warm regards,
Duong Van Chien
